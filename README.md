#  #100daysofcode / #100daysofweb talk python nav bar

The task for day 3 of this 4 day run (days 13-16) about CSS layout and design was to re-create the nav bar from the 
talk python podcast webpage.

This was more challenging and I learned a lot of new little tricks. I decided to add the hero image and the text over
that too. Here I learned about adding shadow to text and also about creating standalone horizontal lines.

I discovered a lot of new code for CSS styling and also incorporated a google font and an awesome font 
(for the search icon).
